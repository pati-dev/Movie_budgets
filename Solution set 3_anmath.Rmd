```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, tidy = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
cb_palette = c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")
```

# Solution 1

Load the data
```{r}
movies = read.csv("movie_budgets.txt", sep = " ")
```

Apply transformation on budget
```{r}
movies$log_budget <- log10(movies$budget)
```


```{r}
ggpairs(movies, columns = c("log_budget", "length", "year"))
```

Obvious takeaways so far:
  - length and budget seem to be highly correlated and *might be* following a linear relationship
  - Most of the movies in the dataset are ~90 minutes long and were released in the year 2000
  - Relationships of year with length and budget are not clear
